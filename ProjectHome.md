**LangBots** is a framework to make programmable bots fight in a battlefield. The framework itself is written in Python and Pygame, but participants may implement their bots in the programming language they like. Check the Wiki to see how to [Install](Install.md), [BuildYourBot](BuildYourBot.md) and [RunBattles](RunBattles.md).

This is a collaborative project, so anyone with some programming skills are encouraged to participate: send your bots, contribute new sprites, propose enhancements in the API, organize contests, upload battles to Youtube, announce it, whatever.

  * [RobotBattle](http://www.robotbattle.com/): Robot Battle is a programming game that challenges you to design and code adaptable battling robots. Robot Battle is unique because it takes strategy rather than reflexes, accuracy, or timing to succeed. Winning Robot Battle players are those who create the smartest robots. What differentiates one robot from the next is its brain, for which you are responsible.
